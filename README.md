# Iterated perturbation theory IPT on Matsubara axis
 Hubbard model at half-filling using the fftw package and the numerical recipie for Green's function FFT. At half filling, the symmetry of Green's functions have been enforced. This can enhance the stability at low temperature and near Uc2. The attenutaion factor have been added, also the tail correction in Inverse Fourier transform.

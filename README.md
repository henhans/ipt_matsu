# Iterated perturbation theory IPT on Matsubara axis
 Hubbard model at half-filling using the fftw package and the numerical recipie for Green's function FFT. At half filling, the symmetry of Green's functions have been enforced. This can enhance the stability at low temperature and near Uc2. The attenutaion factor have been added, also the tail correction in Inverse Fourier transform. One can adjust the parameter U and T in the main.cpp. The output are Green's function in Gw_final.dat and self-energy in Sw_final.dat.

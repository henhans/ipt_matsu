# Iterated perturbation theory IPT on Matsubara axis
# The half-filling case done using the fftw package and the numerical recipie FFT. At half filling, the symmetry of Green's functions have been enforced. This can enhance the stability at low temperature and close to Uc2. The attenutaion factor have been added, also the tail correction in Inverse Fourier transform.
